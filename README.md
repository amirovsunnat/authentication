## üöÄ Quick Start

Getting started is a breeze. Follow these steps to kickstart your Flutter app's authentication:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirovsunnat/authentication.git
```

### 2. Firebase setup

- Create a new project in the Firebase Console.
- Configure Firebase Authentication with your preferred providers:
- Email/Password: Enable Email/Password authentication.
- Google Sign-In: Set up Google Sign-In authentication.
- Download the Firebase configuration file (google-services.json for Android or GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS) and place it in the respective platform-specific folders (android/app for Android and ios/Runner for iOS).

### 3. Dependencies

Ensure your Flutter project includes these dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file:
